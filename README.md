# Connectome_analysis


At the following [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AsEaiju3l62fbwv-SrANfvTJyCqwd_4N?usp=sharing) are available the complete dataset modular structures. 

### Folder *notebooks*
Consists of .ipynb jupyter notebooks containing python code for analyzing Connectome data of larval zebrafish atlas as well as EM drosophilia
1. *strahler_number_and_threshold_distance.ipynb* - Code for finding the strahler order of the endoints of each neuron(.swc file). Computing the threshold to seperate the axon terminals and dendrites of each neuron. Storing the .swc data with unitary value of strahler number of each neuron seperately. Storing the .swc data with info of axo terinal and dendrites of eachg neuroin separately.  
2. *Directed_model.ipynb* - Code for constructing assymetric adjacency matrix(or directed network) from larval zebrafish .swc data
